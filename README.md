# Simple Neural Network

I've built this neural network based on the first 2 chapters of Michael Nielsen's book, which
you can find at http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/

The problem I was trying to solve was the classic digit classification problem, if you want to
try it out for yourself you can find the dataset here : http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
